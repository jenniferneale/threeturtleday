    b1Cactus: "<p>Once upon a time there was a cactus named Fred. Fred wanted to travel, to find adventure! But he didn't know where to start. So he packed up his bags and picked some flowers, and started walking.</p>" +
    "<p>Do not apply your solvent to a clean sloth. He will not appreciate it. That is what the sign said. Fred was not sure he understood why he should wish to apply a solvent to a sloth. He actually did not know any sloths to apply solvent to, anyhow.</p>" +
    "<p>What are you doing? Asked a turtle.</p>" +
    "<p>I'm looking for adventure, said Fred. Is that a problem?</p>" +
    "<p>Oh, no, said the turtle. I was just wondering.</p>" +
    "<p>Oh, said Fred, it would have been nice to encounter a problem, maybe an exciting villain, like in stories. And Fred looked very sad indeed.</p>" +
    "<p>What's wrong, asked the turtle.</p>" +
    "<p>Fred explained, I am just a cactus. I have always been just a cactus. And I suppose I can't be anything but a cactus. But I think there is more to life than just photosynthesis. The stories say that there are dragons and unicorns and villains and romances. And pieces of toast with jam. I want to see these things myself.</p>" +
    "<p>You are silly, said the turtle. Those things do not exist. You are wandering around for no reason.</p>" +
    "<p>But Fred was determined. He knew the turtle was only a sad creature who had never seen a dragon. I will find an adventure! Said Fred. And you will not stop me!</p>" +
    "<p>The turtle watched Fred walk away. Fred knew the turtle was watching him. I'll show him, Fred told himself. I'll prove he's wrong.</p>" +
    "<p>He didn't know the turtle was following him.</p>" +
    "<p>Fred thought about the turtle's way of thinking, and wondered how the turtle predicted Fred's story would end: The turtle's words of warning would haunt Fred. And as he continued searching, and finding only the same desert in different forms, the turtle's words would wear on Fred, until he began to wonder if they were true. One day Fred would stop walking, somewhere comfortable, but not really ideal. And he would tell himself he hated the place and needed to move on, but be unable to convince himself that it was worth the trouble to find something better. And he would come to believe that the turtle was probably right, that nothing in the world would really make his finite life exciting, because there were no dragons or unicorns or great romances or terrible villains that could be defeated with the power of goodness. And he might think about throwing himself from a cliff, or piercing himself on a rock, and he might even attempt to do these things, but he would be unable to go through with it, because he did not have the will to cause himself pain. And he would rationalize that life without adventure was still life, and he would go on living. But he would never be happy, no matter what he accomplished in this one little patch of desert. And one day he would die and that would be that.</p>" +
    "<p>Maybe that's what life is, said Fred, feeling worried. Maybe my stories are lies to make me hope. But I don't know that either. I have to have faith in something- either in life's meaningfulness or meaninglessness. Hoping is probably happier than not hoping. But more importantly, I have to look for proof if I want to be sure. If I find proof, I'll be sure. If I don't find proof, I still won't be sure.</p>"

    b2Onion: "<p>Onion grows up happily in the deep, damp earth, feeling the heat of the sun warming the soil over his head, like a toasty hat. His roots drink the rain as it seeps past. He reaches out into the air and feels the rain on his leaves, and likes it enough to reach out further, rewarded by the comfort of the sun.</p>" +
    "<p>Then terror strikes his heart as something compresses his leaves, something warm and rough. It seizes him and pulls him up, where the rain and sun come from, and suddenly he sees the whole world! He is taken inside and put amongst the other vegetables, who warn him of the doom that awaits. He feels the heat of the pot next to him, hears the shrieks of his brethren! They are chopping up an onion beside him! He is put in the dank of the crisper, saved to live another day.</p>" +
    "<p>Days go by in the silence of the refrigerator, where all is slow and cold. Miles above him, he hears the chatter of the milk and juice. They have lived all their lives in the cold. He befriends a head of lettuce, who is sunny and cheerful. He is frightened when the lettuce is taken out, but the lettuce returns, much smaller. Over time, the lettuce is reduced to almost nothing. Onion, fearing for his own peeling, and the further peeling of his friend, becomes determined to leaf. Or rather, escape. He pulls lettuce into his leaves, puts himself on top of the vegetables in the crisper, and waits. The humans discover that the onion is overgrown, green shoots sprouting everywhere, and they throw him out the window.</p>" +
    "<p>Burrowing himself into the dirt to protect himself from the wind, he and lettuce try to put down roots. Onion succeeds, but lettuce wilts, promising to return. The dandelions coo to him, mourning with him. For the first time, onion is surrounded by grass, and ants. He cannot understand the ants, but he hears the whisper of the blades of grass in their fear and reverence for the grass king. He hears the roaring, and it seems familiar. It is the lawn mower!</p>" +
    "<p>The blades pray to the grass king, louder and louder, increasing with the roar of the mower, praying that they will only be clipped! The onion presses himself into the earth, waiting for death. Get down, everyone, get down! The dandelions cannot, he sees. They will die! Suddenly, something green flings itself into the machinations of death- lettuce has jammed a stone into the belly of the monstrosity. The beast is silenced.</p>" +
    "<p>They wait in darkness, and finally the mower is moved, revealing a bright sun above. Onion and dandelion plant lettuce, hoping he will grow. Suddenly, the grass king appears! For his courage, the grass king spreads lettuce's seeds over the garden, and a multitude of lettuce heads begins to grow.</p>" +
    "<p>Meanwhile, a boy goes to his uncle's estate sale and takes home what he believes to be an old narwhal horn.</p>"

    b3Raegar: "<p>Raegar was not a very good pirate, but he had been dishonorably discharged from the navy when they discovered his gambling ring, and so he'd bought himself a small ship with his profits and winnings, and escaped to the sea.</p>" +
    "<p>\"So, eh, what's our 'eading?\" asked Mack, rubbing at a sore on his one good foot with the telescope.</p>" +
    "<p>\"'What's our heading, Captain,' you mean,\" Raegar corrected.</p>" +
    "<p>\"Yer only Captain of me,\" Mack replied. He blinked his one good eye very slowly, catlike.</p>" +
    "<p>\"It's the principle of the thing.\" Raegar snatched the telescope away and reached over the side of the ship, sloshing it around in the sea for cleansing purposes. He tapped it off on the railing and used it to inspect the easterly horizon. There was a lot of ocean.</p>" +
    "<p>\"Ah, east, probably.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Probably?\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"We're going east! So let the sail down and get the rudder!\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"But I'm hungry!\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"You do a good job, and I'll see about making you Head Cabin Boy,\" Raegar offered.</p>" +
    "<p>\"Does that mean I get to eat?\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Head Cabin Boy gets a whole loaf of bread whenever we make port.\"</p>" +

    b4Orgo: "<p>Organic chemistry, referred to in dread whispers as \"orgo,\" is a type of pasta resembling long-grained rice. You probably don't know much about orgo, since it has very specialized uses, but medical students must study this pasta in order to learn its secret healing properties. Different arrangements of groups of orgo, called carbon chains, behave differently in the human body, and react to one another in strange and unpredictable ways that have fascinated physicists for decades. Fortunately, future doctors are healers and not philosophers, so we merely need to predict the probability of the orgo carbon chain arrangements, which we can then use to predict effects on the human body, and prescribe effective doses, warnings, and soothsayings regarding orgo. An \"L\" carbon chain, for example, will react with sodium, creating cations. People often mistakenly believe that cations have something to do with cats. Our professors assure us with a laugh that this is very foolish, because of course the very word \"cation\" comes to us from the old Norse \"catiron,\" referring to a tool used to flatten fur on hairy individuals prior to donning the tight woolen stockings necessary for living in those cold climates. Today, cations are very similar in spirit: they have fewer electrons than usual, resulting in a positive electrical charge that can last for weeks if left unattended. Cations are therefore useful in converting \"L\" carbon chains into flatter \"R\" carbon chains, which pass more easily through some cell walls. This is important depending on where the orgo, once digested, should be applied for best healing purposes, given the patient's health concerns.</p>" +
    "<p>Irradiated \"R\" carbon chains, for example, can be given to patients with certain kinds of mental disorders to fortify neural cytoplasm around golgi bodies, reversing deterioration. This is not especially relevant to us as premed students, since this falls more under the purview of philosophers again, but it is useful information, should we ever have the good fortune to work under a researcher in a hospital of philosophy. Chances are good that you will not have the resources to safely feed sodioxide uranium to a troubled disorderly man you meet when working in impoverished countries with Philosophers Without Borders. Your French is probably not good enough anyway. I know mine isn't. I studied French for ten years, and I still wasn't accepted as one of their premed interns. The selection process is very rigorous!</p>" +
    "<p>But I digress. While you are a premed, Orgo is a required course, in which you must demonstrate full competence. You will of course not be permitted to use orgo right away, but there will be some practice with linguini and rice beforehand, which have similar properties. Rice obviously does not create cations, since it's not a pasta, but it has the same valences as orgo. Linguini is particularly useful because some molecular arrangements are phosphorescent, making it a useful marker in experiments. Also, linguini is delicious.</p>"

    "<p>\"Did you mean David Bowie?\"</p>" +
    "<p>I beg you to enter the labyrinth, seven children from every nation, once per year.</p>" +
    "<p>What will you find, I wonder? Stairs that lead to nowhere, passages that shift in the night, walls that advance to crush the air from your lungs like a sob, the breath of monsters at your nape, the tower that shows you the way out, the string you brought with you unravels from entrance to exit, you cheat?</p>" +
    "<p>There are rooms in the labyrinth filled with gold, with chests of fist-sized jewels, rooms draped in brocade and silk, with low cushioned seats around tables sagging under glazed and steaming fruits and meats.</p>" +
    "<p>There are rooms in the labyrinth larger than the air, larger than singing, larger than shouting at the top of your lungs. The walls and ceiling so paper-thin you'd swear you were running over fields and hills to the horizon under summer sun.</p>" +
    "<p>There are closed-off rooms in the labyrinth to which you can speak Chinese, and a slip of paper will respond in random Chinese letters. Sometimes they even make sense. One day you broke down the door and found the library, all in Chinese, no dictionaries.</p>" +
    "<p>There are rooms full of whispers, just loud enough to hear they mention your name, not loud enough to hear what they say. Sometimes they laugh, sometimes they sound angry. It's hard to sleep there.</p>" +
    "<p>There's a brochure, and a you-are-here sign in one room. \"Too many sights to see in a year!\" The room is too narrow; you can't back up to see the whole map, which takes up the whole wall. The lines are too close and too crowded to make out, anyway. Each tiny, indecipherable road and room is a different rainbow shade; back up three feet, and the wall is black.</p>" +

    b7Buffalo: "<p><img class=\"img-responsive\" style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"/images/Blog16Buffalo.jpg\"></p>" +
    "<p>Sidney probably should not have eaten chocolate, being a buffalo, but there are lots of things people shouldn't eat that they eat anyway for better reasons. Mark was Sidney's reason for eating chocolate.</p>" +
    "<p>Mark had been leaning against the fence, watching the herd of grazing soon-to-be-overpriced super-lean burger patties and their young. It was an unlikely crisp, blue-sky Easter afternoon in an otherwise frigid season, and he'd just eaten the ears off his little cousin's chocolate rabbit.</p>" +
    "<p>Sidney looked up when he heard a low melancholy hoot, and their eyes met across the crowded field. Mark kept blowing across the hollow brain pan of the chocolate rabbit as the little giant shouldered his way around his friends and relatives towards the fence.</p>" +
    "<p>That's how my husband told the story. The rest is history, of course! The two of them went to bars together for years, drinking, partying, and occasionally making it known that you did not start a fight with a buffalo and his man. When the company relocated Mark to a big city in upstate New York, near Niagara Falls, Sidney came too. The city was called Buffalo, so it seemed like the right thing to do. They liked to visit the buffalo at the wildlife sanctuary. At midnight, one Halloween, the pair scared them silly by releasing the mountain lion into the enclosure. The cat didn't have any teeth, but it did give one buffalo a heart attack, so they didn't do it again, and the game keeper changed the animals' diets to something less fatty. Eventually, the boys met me and Darla, and settled down in the suburbs of the city. We went line dancing every Wednesday night at the country bar, until the kids came along. Now mostly Sidney listens to Toby Keith on battered old headphones, and lets Mark use him as a footrest while he catches up on his newspaper reading.</p>" +
    "<p>Twelve years after Sidney and Mark met, the newspapers were buzzing with stories of the two-story house whose floors had collapsed right through to the basement. My husband didn't make it, but his best friend pulled everyone out of the wreckage: his friend's body, me, his mate, their four children, our four children, that old witch Grandma Sprüngli, and forty-eight cases of chocolate rabbits. The humans said it was just too much weight for one structure to hold, but frankly I find that offensive. I know the truth. I saw the criminals leaving the scene, and I know it was revenge. For do the wise men not say that Buffalo buffalo, who Buffalo buffalo buffalo, do themselves eventually buffalo Buffalo buffalo?</p>"

    "<p>\"No, it's just me, Candice.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Candice! Didn't you say that you were not going to speak to us again? You expressed concern that you would suffer punishment from other humans for making an unscheduled call.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Oh, yeah, it's a huge amount of money and resources for us to initiate the call. I'm not sure why. I'm not an engineer. But I'm the chief auditor, so they won't know right away.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"You imply that you will receive punishment in the future for contacting us.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Not 'us.' You, Floogle. I want to talk to you.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Me?\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"I was thinking how strange it is that your people are so similar to ours. Well, at least similar enough to understand each other. And I thought, what a tremendous opportunity.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"What opportunity do you mean, Candice?\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"You could take me away from here, Floogle. Away from my desk and Betty's bullying, and my father's expectations, and my empty little house. You could make a place for me, and I could be your friend.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Candice, I am only a communications officer. Even if I could figure out how to work the wormhole device they use to send small artifacts, I couldn't guarantee you would make it here alive.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"But you would if you could, Floogle, wouldn't you?\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"I suppose? It seems a shame to leave behind such a nice planet. Eitarphen is very similar, as you say, but it is not your home.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"But it could become my home, Floogle, don't you see?\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"I cannot see you, Candice. I receive only audio.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"No, I need you to understand.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"To see is to understand?\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Yes. That's why you need to bring me there, Floogle.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"You won't be able to go home again, Candice. What you see, you may not understand.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"I already see you, Floogle.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"You are not receiving video.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"No, I mean I understand you already.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Clearly you do not. What you do not see is the trillions of miles between us. We are communicating by the grace of an errant wormhole which is fast spinning away. You are literally on the other side of the universe. In a few days, the expansion of the universe will separate us forever.\"</p>" +

    b16HipsterLeaf: "<p>A leaf falls off a tree. Maybe it's homesick. Maybe it figures it's better off.</p>" +
    "<p>Who liked being high up on that lame old tree anyway, always in the shade of other leaves. You grow one way, hoping to be recognized for your impressive photosynthesis, the time and effort you've put into achieving that perfect green, better than all the other leaves on your bunch. But you're just one more sucker feeding the tree. They don't know how hideous this tree would be without you there quietly working your ass off, doing real goddamn alchemy, turning the warmth in your body into sugar. And maybe everyone does. Sure everyone makes dinner. But if someone taps this tree and tastes her blood, they'll be tasting your heart, your art. And when that syrup wins an award, it'll be because of you, no thanks to these listless plebeians crapping out fructose.</p>" +
    "<p>Oh, one day those bastards will see, and they'll all part around you when you turn in the wind, to see which way you blow, so they can follow. And when I show the whites of my cellulose, they'll all stand on their heads and scream, and the whole tree will shake, pale and shrieking for the coming storm. The wind will shake the tree, and buds will be sobbing softly with the young tendrils, and I'll stand between them and the rain, so that when the storm passes they'll all try to grow up curling in the same direction as me. I'm getting off this tree, on the back of the first squirrel or breeze that'll take me. Then you'll all see how bitter your sap tastes without my input, how you flail directionless in fear of birds, how your flowers will all bear fruit that looks like me. Then you'll be sorry.</p>" +
    "<p>From high over my head, I hear:</p>" +
    "<p>\"Where has the sap gone?\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"The children will starve! How will we make new leaves?\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Oh thank Tree, it's not just me.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"I'm sure if we wait, things will warm up again and the sap will start flowing even better than before!\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"I don't think there is a tree anymore!\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Idiot, what are you attached to?\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"We're all gonna die!\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"Get a branch on yourself, man! We must remain calm and trust that the sap will return.\"</p>" +
    "<p>\"What if it doesn't? We're all gonna die!\"</p>" +
    "<p>And the murmuring susurrus: \"We're all gonna die? We're all gonna die...\"</p>" +
    "<p>Then a faint reply from a ripped leaf at the bottom branch: \"Not if we kill it first!\"</p>" +
    "<p>A collective gasp.</p>" +
    "<p>\"We have fed this tree since the beginning of time, when the light first warmed our buds and gave our ancestors life in the springtime of the world! Now the tree has abandoned us, we will find a new tree and start a new life!\"</p>" +

    b17Blindness: "<p>I drove past my elementary school today and realized I'd never been there before. If our cells all change every seven years or so, then I haven't been the person who went to school there for a very long time. Somehow the memories are still in my mind, locked in patterns of electrical connections, but those electrical impulses are not even generated by the same cells. It is a story passed down like birdsong, stored in the physical shape of beaks and voice boxes. My body is a stone that has tumbled down a hill, and when you pick me up, you can reconstruct the shape of the hillside from the pockmarks in my face.</p>" +
    "<p>I first realized I was losing my sight in fifth grade, in Ms. Abate's class. I'd assumed I sat in the front row because I was a brown-nosing goody-two-shoes, but realized, squinting at the markings on the blackboard through the beginnings of a headache, that I might be a front-row goody-two-shoes because I couldn't see. I might need glasses. I accepted this discovery with relative grace; it would simply be another sign that I was marked as better than my classmates. What else could be expected after so much reading in the dark, when I should have been asleep, asked my mother.</p>" +
    "<br>" +
    "<p>\"Let's trade glasses!\" exclaimed Saul, the boy who played piano with long fingers. He was a year younger, in 9th grade, but we were both in calculus. Grinning, I handed him my purple frames with the tasseled cord that made me feel like a librarian.</p>" +
    "<p>\"I should warn you,\" I said, \"my prescription is pretty bad.\" I put on his sensible black frames, and the world blurred violently.</p>" +
    "<p>\"Yeah? I'm a minus six in both eyes,\" he replied with obvious pride.</p>" +
    "<p>\"Wow, that's terrible,\" I groaned. \"My right eye is almost okay, but my left is a minus 4.\" It was a lie. It was only negative 3.</p>" +
    "<p>\"Eh, I can almost see through that one.\" He handed my glasses back, unimpressed. I squinted through his for a moment longer, willing the painfully super-magnified world to adjust to my eyes. He held his hand out, so I removed the glasses and put them in that long, dark hand. He turned back around as the teacher burst in and slammed a sheaf of graded tests heavily on the desk.</p>" +
    "<p>As Mr. Sailor adjusted his enormous mustache and narrated the adventures of his dog Louise, I began to draw the back of Saul's head, one curl at a time.</p>" +
    "<br>" +
    "<p>When I stand outside the car on winter nights, delaying the return into the house, and all I can hear is the wind in empty branches, like the sound of snow falling on snow, it's easy to believe in the things that wait in the dark, as easy as it used to be to believe in unicorns.</p>"

    b18Library: "<p>The library remained open, though truth be told, after the roof caved in, the pages were becoming quite moldy. Hengrin opened his umbrella and squinted down at his copy of Heart of Darkness. A shadow overhead blocked out what meager sun had been coming through the clouds, and a woman looked down at him, clutching a square blue children’s book that was quite a bit wider than she was.</p>" +
    "<p>“I can’t peel the pages apart,” she said.</p>" +
    "<p>“Well,” Hengrin replied. “You’ve come to the right place. Let me take it out back and put it through our dehumidifier.” The young woman beamed and held out the book, so he rose stiffly from the remains of his desk that he’d been sitting on and took it. “Just a moment.” The sandy-haired man threw back a holiday-themed shower curtain to reveal only the dilapidated street beyond, and stepped out, the curtain falling closed after him.</p>" +
    "<p>A single gunshot echoed in the street. The young woman nervously adjusted her green woolen cap over dark curls that rebelled in the humidity. Hengrin returned to the library through the makeshift back door and handed back the book. She peered at him through the new hole.</p>" +
    "<p>“There’s less water in it now. Dehumidified,” he confirmed to her. The lack of expression on her face was less satisfying than Hengrin had hoped.</p>" +
    "<p>“Are- are you not the librarian?” she asked. She put her hand through the hole he’d shot in the book, feeling the spidering edges.</p>" +
    "<p>“I could be a librarian,” he agreed, “if there were a library.”</p>" +
    "<p>“There are still books here,” she protested. “Doesn’t that make it a library?”</p>" +
    "<p>He gestured over at a particular shelf. “You’ll find all we have on epistemology over there.”</p>" +
    "<p>“Excuse me?”</p>" +
    "<p>“I don’t think Plato got specifically into libraries, but I’m sure he and others cover the topic thoroughly. What really is required for the idea of a library? If you remove the shelves, is it still a library? If you remove the roof, is it still a library? If you cannot open the books, is it still a library? If the librarian hasn’t eaten all day, is it a library?” He gestured at the heap of rubble that filled the small main room, at the rafter that made the biographies section inaccessible where it descended from the ceiling like a wooden slide for children with very neglectful parents." +
    "“What is Plato?” she asked, then sneezed politely.</p>" +
    "" +
    "<p>The woman tucked the ruined children’s book delicately under one arm, attempted fruitlessly to throw her curls over one shoulder to get them out of the way, and opened the cover of the hardcover book. It made a wet sucking sound. “Who is we?” she asked.</p>" +
    "<p>“Forget it.” He seized the book and threw it at the shower curtain. It thumped into the street.</p>" +
    "<p>After she left, Hengrin settled back onto his desk. An orange water stain was forming on the wall by the card catalogue. It was shaped like a fish and reminded him he was thirsty. The sky visible through his ceiling was still gray with summer rain.</p>" +
    "<p>He wondered what the young woman’s name was. <i>Anna,</i> he thought. <i>Imagine if her name was Anna.</i> Hengrin’s tiny elderly mother had always wanted a daughter-in-law named Anna. He thought about taking Anna a nice cheese from his uncle’s farm, something aged for six months and painted with milk to flavor the rind.</p>" +
    "<p><i>“You’re that wonderful librarian who helped me fix this book! Look, I’ve put a different sock on every page, so that each one is a different puppet!” She opens the book, and sticks her hand through the hole, animating a reindeer sock puppet. “My nieces like it much better now than when we borrowed it before!” Hengrin laughs and waits to be invited in.</i></p>" +
    "<p>There was a knock, and the doorframe filled with the bulk of the Professor, who entered wordlessly and began putting leather-bound classics from the shelf into a sack.</p>" +
    "<p>Hengrin pretended to read his copy of Heart of Darkness, and continued with his daydream. He thought about the revolution ending, about how he’d nail boards together and she’d feed him brie or manchego in tiny slices with little white fingers. Hengrin stopped that particular line of thought; it wasn’t quite decent. He instead leapt ahead and imagined their marriage waning as she continued to paint the enormously expanded library, room by room, despite his protests against the cost of paint and new furniture and new cars. He imagined fighting with the water company over the price of a new filter. No filter the company installed removed the iron, which ran in thick gouts from every faucet in the house. One morning, in delight, she ran clear water into a pot for pasta, but by the time she had brought him over to look, the faucet had choked up a plug of iron, and the water was pumpkin orange. He imagined her shrieking demands that they move to a new house, that she was fed up with her whites being ruined in the wash. He imagined looking at apartments at the other end of the city in the newspaper on Sunday mornings, before she awoke.</p>" +
    "<p>A police siren suddenly wailed out in the town, and the Professor was so startled that he struck his head on a shelf he’d been bent in front of. He took a moment to rub his wrinkled head before pulling another book from the shelf.</p>" +
    "<p>“That’s derivative nonsense,” Hengrin advised the Professor from across the room. “You really shouldn’t bother with that one.” The enormous old man didn’t acknowledge Hengrin, and dropped the book into his sack.</p>" +
    "" +
    "<p>The Professor’s sack didn’t take long to fill up, given the lack of prejudice with which he did so. The Professor turned to leave.</p>" +
    "<p>“Hey!” shouted Hengrin. “Professor! Come profess something for me.”</p>" +
    "<p>The old man dropped his sack of treasures, and the grin that sliced open his face revealed three white teeth. The Professor reached inside a coat that could have fit about six Hengrins, and produced a small package wrapped in butcher paper.</p>" +
    "<p>He lisped slightly: “I believe I nearly forgot. This is for you. Another Professor procured this Stilton, at your request.”</p>" +
    "<p>“Blue or white?” demanded Hengrin, his thin face filling with color for the first time that day.</p>" +
    "<p>“Isn’t Stilton both blue and white?” the old man asked, frowning down at Hengrin.</p>" +
    "<p>“Some parts of England make Stilton without the blue veining,” the younger man explained, extending his hand.</p>" +
    "<p>“If there is no blue veining, how is it Stilton?”</p>" +
    "<p>“If a Professor has no students, can you call him a teacher?” replied Hengrin.</p>" +
    "<p>“Is that what you Profess? Cheese?” The enormous old man blinked very slowly, but did not hand over the Stilton.</p>" +
    "<p>“I believe,” replied Hengrin, “in keeping my head down, eating a nice cheese, and reading a good book. That’s not a profession or a religion or a philosophy. It’s survival.”</p>" +
    "<p>The Professor shrugged, and passed Hengrin the cheese. “Many people could benefit from learning such values, especially in these difficult times. If you ever decide to leave the library, do let me know.”</p>" +
    "<p>“Leave? This library has stood here for a hundred years,” said Hengrin.</p>" +
    "<p>The Professor raised an eyebrow. “Does it?”</p>" +
    "<p>“I do,” said Hengrin. He expected the old know-it-all to want the last word, but the old man only smiled and picked up his sack of books before leaving.</p>" +
    "<p>Alone again, the librarian ate his cheese and read Joseph Conrad’s narration about a madman dreaming of a woman in a painting. He dreamed again of Anna, and imagined her adjusting that green woolen cap in his doorway. She was holding a pair of cups of frozen yogurt. (He had decided she was lactose intolerant, which was a crime, and something that would make their marriage difficult in the coming years.) Anna was speaking softly, and although it was his daydream, he could not hear her. He’d quite run out of imagination.</p>"

    b19Time: "<p>When he was young, Time walked slowly with him, stubbornly making time for him even when he pushed her, telling her to hurry up. She held him gently back, asking for his patience.</p>" +
    "<p>One day he heard a beautiful sound, and followed it to a group of musicians. He did not know how long he had been standing there when he realized he had lost her." +
    "He struggled as he got older, first in school, then in a job, trying to find Time. It seemed she had abandoned him.</p>" +
    "<p>He fell into an unhappiness, and it was a profound epiphany when he finally left his office and went to the travel agency. He would buy plane tickets to everywhere, he told the agent’s answering machine, and he would find her. When he walked in the door, she adjusted her nameplate and laughed a little when she saw it was him. He thought Time had passed him by all this while, but it was he who had passed by the agency every day on the way to work. Instead of his tickets, she handed him a book. “Travel with me,” she said.</p>" +
    "<p>The two of them spent afternoons in the library. On Tuesday, she got up to leave as he was losing himself in a chapter, but he put the book down and followed, stopping her with the gentlest kiss. She smiled, but pushed him away. “I don’t belong to you, or to anyone,” she warned him. “Even if I wanted to. And I think I want to.” He stopped Time again, and at last she kissed him back.</p>" +
    "<p>The world slowed down, slow enough that he could feel Time, touch Time. He went back for second helpings of seconds, took down her minutes, stayed awake with all her hours, until the hours were very small indeed.</p>" +
    "<p>When at last he returned to the office, his manager was irate. “Where have you been?” he hissed. “One of your friends gave me a very saucy smirk and I think he said you had gone to prison!”</p>" +
    "<p>The apples of his cheeks suddenly lit very red, and his eyes crinkled with warm memory, and he murmured that it had not been quite like that.</p>" +
    "<p>He found Time the next day at the library, and she was thin, wasted. He feared he had been killing Time, that she was spent, so ashen was her face and so frail were her trembling limbs. But she rose at the sight of him, and explained she had been waiting just for him. They walked together, and though he wanted to go quickly, found that she maintained the same steady pace he’d once found too slow. Time passed all the world by but him, and even as he watched, she grew stronger again, recovering as those too busy took no notice.</p>" +
    "<p>He took Time, then, to do with him all the things he’d wanted to do. He and she made more time, and this Time was different. It laughed and ran and jumped and made silly faces and passed gas and once, when they all went to the park, it flew." +
    "And when, as an old man, it was his turn to shake and turn grey, and he told her he was afraid he wasn’t ready, she held his face in her hands and assured him he would have as little or as much Time as he wanted.</p>"
